\usage{
plot_volcano(
  gimap_dataset,
  facet_rep = TRUE,
  reps_to_drop = c("Day05_RepA_early")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gimap_dataset}{A special dataset structure that is setup using has had gi scores calculated.}

\item{facet_rep}{Should the replicates be wrapped with facet_wrap()?}

\item{#'}{@param reps_to_drop Names of replicates that should be not plotted (Optional)}
}
\description{
This plot is meant to be functionally equivalent to Fig S5K (for HeLa, equivalent of Fig 3a for PC9).
Scatter plot of target-level observed versus expected CRISPR scores in the HeLa screen.
The solid line is the linear regression line for the negative control (single KO) pgRNAs,
while dashed lines indicate Â± 2 residuals.
