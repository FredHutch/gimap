# Looking at filters for the data

## Zero count filter

This first filter looks at which pgRNA constructs have a raw count of zero for any of the samples

```{r}
list_of_qc_things$zerocount_df
```

## Low plasmid cpm filter

This second filter considers the plasmid (the first sample or 0 time point) and the CPM at that time point. If a cutoff isn't provided by a user, the cutoff is determined by using the quantiles of the available plasmid CPMs.


The distribution of those plasmid CPMs are shown in the histogram below.

```{r}
list_of_qc_things$plasmid_hist_nocutoff
```

<details><summary> Saved plot locations: </summary>

This plot is saved as 

  * a `.png` in ``r list_of_qc_things$plasmid_hist_nocutoff_file_loc$png``
  * a `.pdf` in ``r list_of_qc_things$plasmid_hist_nocutoff_file_loc$pdf``

</details>

The stats used to find the cutoff are in this table

```{r}
list_of_qc_things$plasmid_stats
```

The distribution of those plasmid CPMs are shown in the histogram below, but this time, the suggested cutoff is a vertical dashed line.

```{r}
list_of_qc_things$plasmid_hist_cutoff
```

<details><summary> Saved plot locations: </summary>

This plot is saved as 

  * a `.png` in ``r list_of_qc_things$plasmid_hist_cutoff_file_loc$png``
  * a `.pdf` in ``r list_of_qc_things$plasmid_hist_cutoff_file_loc$pdf``

</details>

```{r}
list_of_qc_things$plasmid_filter_report
```

## Combining the two filters

When combining the filters, by default, if either of the filters raises a flag for a pgRNA construct, then the pgRNA is flagged to be filtered out.

list_of_qc_things$num_filtered_report
```
