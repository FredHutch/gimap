# Unfiltered/raw data

## Counts CDF

```{r}
list_of_qc_things$counts_cdf
```

## Histogram of cpm values by sample

```{r}
list_of_qc_things$sample_cpm_histogram
```

## Sample Correlation heatmap (unfiltered data)

```{r}
list_of_qc_things$sample_cor_heatmap_unfiltered
```

# Looking at filters for the data

## Zero count filter

This first filter looks at which pgRNA constructs have a raw count of zero for any of the samples

```{r}
#print_kbl(list_of_qc_things$zerocount_df)
list_of_qc_things$zerocount_df
```

## Low plasmid cpm filter

This second filter considers the plasmid (the first sample or 0 time point) and the CPM at that time point. If a cutoff isn't provided by a user, the cutoff is determined by using the quantiles of the available plasmid CPMs.


The distribution of those plasmid CPMs are shown in the histogram below.

```{r}
list_of_qc_things$plasmid_hist_nocutoff
```

The stats used to find the cutoff are in this table

```{r}
#print_kbl(list_of_qc_things$plasmid_stats)
list_of_qc_things$plasmid_stats
```

The distribution of those plasmid CPMs are shown in the histogram below, but this time, the suggested cutoff is a vertical dashed line.

```{r}
list_of_qc_things$plasmid_hist_cutoff
```

```{r}
#print_kbl(list_of_qc_things$plasmid_filter_report)
list_of_qc_things$plasmid_filter_report
```

## Combining the two filters

When combining the filters, by default, if either of the filters raises a flag for a pgRNA construct, then the pgRNA is flagged to be filtered out.

```{r}
#print_kbl(list_of_qc_things$combined_filter_df)
list_of_qc_things$combined_filter_df
```

```{r}
#print_kbl(list_of_qc_things$which_filter_df)
list_of_qc_things$which_filter_df
```
